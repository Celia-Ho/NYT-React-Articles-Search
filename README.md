# NYT React Articles Search

This is a MERN full stack application that searches the New York Times article API with search terms and search dates.  It also allows users to read or save the articles.

Users can enter search terms with search dates.  Search results are returned with headlines, dates, a summary, and links to the original NYT articles.  If no results are returned, a message is displayed to inform the user of that.

In the saved articles page, users have access to their saved articles, and can read or delete them at will.
